  Lets Start The concept : 

    * Introduction to Cybesecurity --
          cybersecurity is the protection of cyber-space (which includes hardware, software, networks, and their servers, peripheral devices, data and information, and all other components associated with technology) and internet-connected systems from both internal as well as external threats and cybercriminals.
    - different Security
        -- Network Security.
        -- System Security.
        -- Application Security.
        -- Information Security.
        -- Web Security.
        -- Mobile Security
    
    * Ethical Hacking -- 
         Hacking refers to the act of compromising digital devices and networks through unauthorized access to an account or computer system.

    * Windows and linux --

          - Windows is a proprietary operating system developed by Microsoft. It’s widely used on PCs and laptops and it uses a hybrid kernel.
          - Linux is a Unix-like open-source operating system. It’s free to use and allows users to modify its source code and it uses a monolithic kernel.

    * Virtual Machine --
          Virtual Machine is defined as a computer resource that functions like a physical computer and makes use of software resources only instead of using any physical computer for functioning, running programs, and deploying the apps.
          -- there are two types of virtual Machine:
                1. VM Ware.
                2. VirtualBox.
